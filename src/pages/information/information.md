# Information and knowledge

![alt text](../../../public/01-what-are-data-01.png "Data")


• *Data* refers to raw, unprocessed facts, observations, or measurements. It consists of discrete and objective elements without context or meaning. Data can be represented in various formats, such as numbers, text, or images.

• *Information* is the result of processing and organizing data to make it meaningful and useful. It provides context, relevance, and understanding. Information is structured, interpreted, and presented in a way that facilitates comprehension and decision-making.

• *Knowledge* is a deeper level of understanding that goes beyond mere information. It is acquired through experience, learning, and the application of information. Knowledge involves the assimilation, synthesis, and internalization of information, enabling individuals to make connections, draw conclusions, and apply insights in relevant contexts.

• *Wisdom* is the highest level of understanding and is characterized by sound judgment, discernment, and the ability to apply knowledge and experience in a thoughtful and insightful manner. Wisdom goes beyond factual knowledge and involves a deep understanding of underlying principles, values, and ethics. It encompasses the ability to make wise and balanced decisions, consider long-term consequences, and provide guidance or advice to others.

Data is raw and unprocessed information, information is processed and organized data, knowledge is the assimilated understanding derived from information and experience, and wisdom is the application of knowledge and experience with sound judgment and insight

## Characteristics ##

Information possesses several characteristics and is generated from data through a process of organization and contextualization. The characteristics of information include:

• *Relevance* Information is relevant to a specific context or purpose. It is selected and filtered from the available data based on its applicability and significance to the intended use.

• *Accuracy* Information is accurate and free from errors or distortions. It is based on reliable and valid data sources and is processed with care to ensure precision and correctness.

• *Completeness* Information is complete and includes all necessary details and elements relevant to the context. It provides a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter without significant omissions.

• *Timeliness* Information is generated and delivered in a timely manner, ensuring that it is current and up-to-date. It is relevant and useful within the timeframe required for decision-making or action.

• *Clarity* Information is presented clearly and in a manner that is easily understandable to the intended audience. It is organized, structured, and expressed in a way that minimizes ambiguity and confusion.

• *Format* Information is presented in a suitable format or medium, such as text, graphs, charts, or visuals, depending on the nature of the data and the preferences of the recipients.

## Generation of information ##
The generation of information from data involves several steps:

• *Collection* Data is collected from various sources, such as surveys, experiments, observations, or databases. It can be in raw form and may require cleaning or preprocessing.

• *Processing* Data is processed by organizing, sorting, filtering, and transforming it into a more meaningful format. This can involve calculations, aggregations, or statistical analysis.

• *Analysis* Data is analyzed to uncover patterns, relationships, or trends. Various techniques, such as statistical analysis, data mining, or modeling, can be used to derive insights and knowledge.

• *Interpretation* The analyzed data is interpreted in the context of the problem or question at hand. It involves understanding the implications, drawing conclusions, and making connections between different pieces of information.

• *Communication*: The generated information is communicated to the intended audience through reports, presentations, visualizations, or other forms of dissemination. It should be tailored to the needs and understanding of the recipients.

By going through these steps, data is transformed into meaningful information that can be used for decision-making, problem-solving, or gaining understanding in various domains.
