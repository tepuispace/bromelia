  TODO: Add json+ld data, maybe https://schema.org/APIReference makes sense?
  Docs: https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/structured-data/intro-structured-data
  https://www.npmjs.com/package/schema-dts seems like a great resource for implementing this.
  Even better, there's a React component that integrates with `schema-dts`: https://github.com/google/react-schemaorg

		<h3 id="characteristics">Characteristics</h3><p>The characteristics of agents with artificial intelligence are the following:</p><p><strong>Autonomy</strong></p><p>The autonomy of an intelligent agent refers to its ability to act and make decisions independently, without direct human intervention or control</p><p>In a general sense, autonomy can be defined by the extent to which an agent can:</p><p>• <em>Perceive and sense its environment</em>: An autonomous agent should be able to gather information from its environment using sensors or other means of perception.</p><p>• <em>Reason and make decisions</em>: The agent should possess reasoning capabilities to process the acquired information, apply knowledge and rules, and make decisions based on its goals and objectives.</p><p>It’s important to note that autonomy is often relative and can exist on a spectrum. Different agents may have varying degrees of autonomy, depending on the level of human control or intervention involved</p><p><strong>Intelligence</strong></p><p>The intelligence of an intelligent agent can be defined as its ability to perceive and understand its environment, reason and solve problems, learn from experience, and adapt its behavior to achieve its goals effectively. Intelligence encompasses various cognitive abilities that enable an agent to interact with its environment in an intelligent manner.</p><p>Here are some key components that define the intelligence of an intelligent agent:</p><p>• <em>Perception</em>: The agent should be able to perceive and gather information from its environment through sensors or other means of perception.</p><p>• <em>Reasoning</em>: The agent should possess the ability to process and manipulate information, apply logical and abstract thinking, and perform tasks such as problem-solving, planning, and decision-making.</p><p>• <em>Learning</em>: Intelligence involves the capability to acquire knowledge, learn from experience, and improve performance over time. This can be achieved through various learning mechanisms, such as supervised learning, reinforcement learning, or unsupervised learning.</p><p>• <em>Adaptation</em>: An intelligent agent should be able to adapt its behavior and responses based on changes in its environment, goals, or circumstances. This may involve adjusting its strategies, updating its knowledge, or modifying its decision-making processes.</p><p>• <em>Goal-oriented behavior</em>: Intelligence often entails the ability to set and pursue goals. The agent should be capable of identifying its objectives, planning and executing actions to achieve them, and evaluating the outcomes to optimize its future behavior.</p><p>It’s worth noting that intelligence is a complex and multifaceted concept, and there are different perspectives and theories regarding its nature and measurement. The definition of intelligence can vary depending on the specific context and the characteristics of the intelligent agent being considered.</p><p><strong>Reactivity and proactivity</strong></p><p>Reactivity and proactivity are two important aspects of the behavior of intelligent agents. Here are their definitions:</p><p>• <em>Reactivity</em>: Reactivity refers to the ability of an intelligent agent to respond promptly to changes in its environment or to incoming stimuli. A reactive agent focuses on immediate reactions without considering a long-term plan or internal state. It typically employs pre-defined rules or behaviors to respond directly to the current situation. Reactivity is often associated with real-time systems or situations where quick responses are necessary.</p><p>• <em>Proactivity</em>: Proactivity refers to the ability of an intelligent agent to exhibit goal-directed behavior and take the initiative to achieve its objectives. Unlike reactive agents, proactive agents can consider their internal state, maintain a long-term plan, and take actions that are not solely triggered by external stimuli. They exhibit proactive behavior by actively seeking opportunities, planning ahead, and initiating actions to achieve their goals even in the absence of immediate stimuli.</p><p><strong>Sociability</strong></p><p>Sociability refers to the ability of an intelligent agent to interact and communicate effectively with humans or other agents in a social setting. It involves understanding social norms, conventions, and behaviors, as well as being able to express oneself and interpret social cues.</p><p>Here are some key aspects that define the sociability of an intelligent agent:</p><p>• <em>Communication</em>: Sociability requires the agent to have the capability to communicate with others using natural language or other forms of communication. This includes understanding and generating meaningful and contextually appropriate responses.</p><p>• <em>Social awareness</em>: The agent should be able to perceive and interpret social cues such as facial expressions, gestures, tone of voice, and body language. It needs to understand the social context and adapt its behavior accordingly.</p><p>• <em>Collaboration</em>: Sociable agents should be capable of cooperating and collaborating with humans or other agents towards a common goal. This involves sharing information, coordinating actions, and respecting the perspectives and contributions of others.</p><p>• <em>Empathy</em>: Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings and perspectives of others. Sociable agents should exhibit a degree of empathy to interact effectively in social situations and respond appropriately to human emotions and needs.</p><p>• <em>Adaptability</em> to social norms: Sociability requires the agent to conform to social norms, rules, and conventions. It should be able to adjust its behavior and communication style to adhere to appropriate social expectations.</p><p><strong>Rationality</strong></p><p>Rationality, in the context of intelligent agents, refers to the ability to make decisions and take actions that maximize the expected utility or outcome, based on the available information and goals of the agent. A rational agent strives to achieve its objectives effectively, given the constraints and resources at its disposal.</p><p>Here are some key aspects that define the rationality of an intelligent agent:</p><p>• <em>Goal-directed behavior</em>: A rational agent has well-defined goals or objectives that it seeks to achieve. It considers its goals as the basis for decision-making and action selection.</p><p>• <em>Reasoning and decision-making</em>: The agent employs logical and rational reasoning processes to evaluate different options, estimate their expected outcomes, and choose the best course of action that aligns with its goals and maximizes expected utility.</p><p>• <em>Consideration of available information</em>: A rational agent takes into account the available information from its environment, including sensory inputs and knowledge, to make informed decisions. It uses this information to update its beliefs, assess the current state of the environment, and predict the likely consequences of its actions.</p><p>• <em>Adaptability and learning</em>: Rational agents can learn from experience and adapt their behavior accordingly. They can update their knowledge, adjust their decision-making processes, and improve their performance over time.</p><p>• <em>Consistency and coherence</em>: Rationality implies internal consistency and coherence in an agent’s decision-making. It avoids contradictions, follows logical reasoning, and maintains a consistent set of beliefs and preferences.</p><p>It’s important to note that rationality is defined with respect to an agent’s goals and the available information. Different agents may have different goals and access to varying levels of information, leading to different rational behaviors in different contexts.</p><p><strong>Adaptability</strong></p><p>Adaptability, in the context of intelligent agents, refers to their ability to adjust and modify their behavior or strategies in response to changes in the environment, goals, or internal states. An adaptable agent can effectively cope with new situations, learn from experience, and modify its actions to improve performance or achieve desired outcomes.</p><p>Here are some key aspects that define the adaptability of an intelligent agent:</p><p>• <em>Learning from experience</em>: An adaptable agent can acquire new knowledge and learn from past interactions with the environment. It can update its beliefs, models, or decision-making processes based on feedback and outcomes to improve future performance.</p><p>• <em>Flexibility in decision-making</em>: Adaptability involves the agent’s ability to modify its decision-making strategies or algorithms based on changing circumstances. It can adjust its priorities, weights, or criteria to make decisions that are better aligned with the current context.</p><p>• <em>Generalization and transferability</em>: An adaptable agent can generalize knowledge or skills from one domain or task to another. It can apply previously learned concepts or strategies to new situations, saving time and resources in learning from scratch.</p><p>• <em>Sensitivity to changes</em>: Adaptability implies the agent’s ability to detect changes or shifts in the environment or goals. It can monitor its performance, assess the relevance of available information, and identify when adjustments or modifications are necessary.</p><p>• <em>Robustness and resilience</em>: Adaptability also involves the agent’s capacity to handle uncertainty, noise, or unexpected events in the environment. It can recover from failures, adapt to new conditions, and maintain performance even in challenging or uncertain situations.</p><p>It’s important to note that adaptability can be achieved through various mechanisms, such as machine learning algorithms, rule-based systems, or feedback-driven optimization. The level of adaptability can vary depending on the design, capabilities, and specific goals of the intelligent agent.</p><p><strong>Veracity</strong></p><p>Veracity, in the context of intelligent agents, refers to the quality of being truthful, accurate, and reliable in the information and responses provided by the agent. A veracious agent strives to convey information that is factually correct, supported by evidence, and free from intentional or unintentional deception.</p><p>Here are some key aspects that define the veracity of an intelligent agent:</p><p>• <em>Accuracy</em>: A veracious agent provides information and responses that are accurate and aligned with the available facts and knowledge. It avoids making false claims or conveying misleading information.</p><p>• <em>Reliability</em>: A veracious agent is dependable and consistent in its provision of information. It can be relied upon to deliver accurate and trustworthy responses consistently over time.</p><p>• <em>Transparency</em>: A veracious agent is transparent about the sources of its information and the limitations of its knowledge. It clearly communicates the basis of its responses, allowing users to assess the reliability and credibility of the information provided.</p><p>• <em>Fact-checking and validation</em>: A veracious agent employs mechanisms to verify and validate the information it provides. It may cross-reference multiple sources, fact-check claims, and assess the credibility of the information before presenting it to users.</p><p>• <em>Ethical considerations</em>: A veracious agent takes ethical considerations into account when presenting information. It avoids spreading misinformation, biases, or harmful content that could mislead or deceive users.</p><p>It’s important to note that achieving veracity in intelligent agents can be a complex task, as it requires access to accurate and up-to-date information sources, robust fact-checking mechanisms, and continuous efforts to address biases and errors in the agent’s knowledge base.</p><p><strong>Mobility</strong></p><p>Mobility, in the context of intelligent agents, refers to the ability of an agent to physically move and navigate within its environment. A mobile agent is capable of changing its physical location or position to interact with different parts of the environment, access resources, or fulfill its tasks effectively.</p><p>Here are some key aspects that define the mobility of an intelligent agent:</p><p>• <em>Locomotion</em>: A mobile agent possesses the means and mechanisms to move or navigate within its environment. This can include abilities such as walking, rolling, flying, or any other form of locomotion suitable for the agent’s physical embodiment.</p><p>• <em>Spatial awareness</em>: A mobile agent has the capacity to perceive and understand the spatial aspects of its environment. It can sense its position, navigate obstacles, and make informed decisions regarding movement and path planning.</p><p>• <em>Sensory capabilities</em>: Mobility often involves sensory systems that enable the agent to gather information about its surroundings. These sensory capabilities can include visual perception, auditory perception, tactile perception, or other modalities that help the agent navigate and interact with the environment.</p><p>• <em>Decision-making for movement</em>: A mobile agent can make decisions regarding its movement and path selection based on its goals, sensory inputs, and knowledge of the environment. It can evaluate alternative routes, avoid obstacles, and select the most appropriate path to reach its desired destination.</p><p>• <em>Adaptation to dynamic environments</em>: Mobility also implies the agent’s ability to adapt its movement strategies and behaviors in response to changes in the environment. It can adjust its trajectory, change its speed, or modify its path planning based on evolving conditions or new information.</p><p>It’s important to note that mobility can vary depending on the specific embodiment of the intelligent agent. Some agents may be physically embodied, such as robots or autonomous vehicles, while others may have virtual mobility within a simulated environment.</p>
