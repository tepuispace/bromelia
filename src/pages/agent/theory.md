# Agent

Intelligent systems are computer-based systems that demonstrate intelligent behavior, including perception, reasoning, learning, and adaptation, to assist or replace human decision-making in complex and dynamic environments. These systems are designed to be flexible, autonomous, and able to learn from experience to improve their performance over time.

Today there are three basic computational areas related to the development and definition of agents.
related to the development and definition of agents

**Human-machine interface design**

**AI**

**Object-oriented programming / concurrent programming concurrent** 


The concept of agents also provides a convenient and powerful way to describe a system
computer complex of entity located in some environment that can operate with some degree of autonomy
to complete a task on behalf of a server, that is, sensitive input from that environment and, based on this knowledge through resolution techniques of problems, they determine actions to achieve their
objectives and carry them out autonomously and flexibly. However, unlike the objects that are defined in terms of methods and attributes, the agents are defined in terms of their behavior

However, there is no definition generally accepted from an agent. Actually, it consists of a
set of objectives and sometimes in a library ofplans.

## Agent in artificial intelligence

An intelligent agent is an entity that can recognize an environment, handle knowledge,
to react in a reasonable manner or to act in that environment correctly, it tends to maximize the
expected results with the help of sensors and recognize the environment using actuators, i.e.,
the elements that respond to stimuli in action to act in this work

Intelligent agents are a mechanism that works to achieve predetermined objectives and are represented schematically as an abstract functional system. For this reason, intelligent agents are sometimes they are called abstract intelligent agents (AIAS) for distinguish them from their actual applications

### Areas

Intelligent agents are applied in a wide variety of fields and sectors all over the world. Some of the areas in which smart agents are used are:

**Industrial Automation**: Intelligent agents are used to control and optimize complex industrial processes, improving efficiency and reducing errors.

**Transportation**: Intelligent agents are used in intelligent transportation systems to manage traffic, reduce congestion, improve safety and optimize the use of resources.

**Health**: Smart agents are used in medical applications for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, healthcare management and clinical research.

**Finance**: Smart agents are used in financial applications for risk management, decision making and fraud detection.

**Robotics**: Intelligent agents are used in robotics for movement control and planning, navigation and object recognition
