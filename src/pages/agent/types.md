There are several types of intelligent agents, a short summary of each is described below:

**Agent in artificial intelligence**: An agent in artificial intelligence is a computer program that is designed to act in a certain environment and perform specific tasks, making decisions and acting autonomously. These agents may be designed to interact with humans or with other systems.

**Independent Agents**: Independent agents are those who work autonomously and have the ability to make decisions on their own without the need to consult with other agents. These agents are useful in situations where it is necessary to perform complex tasks and coordinate activities in dynamic environments.

**Distributed Agents**: Distributed agents are those who work together to achieve a common task, exchanging information and coordinating their actions. These agents can be used in situations where a large amount of resources is required or where the task is too complex to be handled by a single agent.

**Multi-system or multi-agent agent**: A multi-system or multi-agent agent is a system that is composed of several agents that interact with each other to achieve a common task. These agents can be designed to work on different platforms or environments and can be used in situations where high coordination between different systems is required.

**Mobile Agents**: Mobile agents are those that have the ability to move from one place to another in a network or distributed system. These agents can be used in situations where it is necessary to move information or perform tasks in different places autonomously.

Intelligent agents can be classified in different ways, some of the most common classifications are:

**Based on the degree of perception and action**:

Reactive agent: makes decisions based solely on the current perception of the environment

• Goal-based agent: Makes decisions based on a long-term goal and a set of rules to achieve that goal.

• Utility-based agent: Makes decisions based on the expected utility or benefit of each action.

**Based on the degree of learning**:
   
• Unlearned agent: Does not have the ability to learn from experience and is limited to making decisions based on predefined rules.

• Agent with simple learning: he can learn from experience and modify his decision rules, but he cannot learn new goals or tasks.

• Agent with complex learning: he has the ability to learn from experience, modify his decision rules and learn new tasks or objectives.

**Based on the degree of autonomy**:

• Fully autonomous agent: it can operate without human intervention.

• Semi-autonomous agent: It can operate autonomously, but may require human intervention in certain situations.

**Based on the structure**:

• Single agent: a single agent operating in a given environment.

• Multi-agent: Several agents working together to achieve a common goal.
