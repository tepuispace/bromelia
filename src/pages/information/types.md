## Quantitative Data ## 

Quantitative data refers to numerical measurements or quantities that can be expressed in terms of numbers. It is based on objective and measurable attributes. Subtypes of quantitative data include:

• *Discrete Data* Discrete data consists of separate and distinct values. Examples include the number of children in a family or the number of cars in a parking lot.

• *Continuous Data* Continuous data represents values that can take on any real number within a certain range. Examples include temperature, weight, or time.

## Qualitative Data ##

Qualitative data describes qualities or characteristics and is typically non-numerical. It is based on subjective attributes and observations. Subtypes of qualitative data include:

• *Nominal* represents categories or names that are mutually exclusive and have no intrinsic order. Examples include gender, nationality, or marital status.

• *Ordinal* data represents categories with a specific order or ranking. While the differences between values may not be precisely quantifiable, the order of the categories is significant. Examples include rating scales or educational levels.

• *Time Series* data captures observations or measurements taken over a period of time at regular intervals. It can be used to analyze trends, patterns, or changes over time. Examples include stock prices, weather data, or population growth.

• *Spatial* data refers to data that is associated with specific geographic locations or coordinates. It includes maps, GPS coordinates, satellite imagery, or any data related to geographic features or areas.

• *Categorical* data represents data in categories or groups that do not have a natural order. It can be either qualitative or quantitative. Examples include types of animals, colors, or customer segments.

• *Binary* data consists of only two possible values, typically represented as 0 and 1. It is used to represent yes/no, true/false, or presence/absence situations.

These are some of the common types of data, each with its own characteristics and uses. The choice of data type depends on the nature of the information being collected and the objectives of the analysis
