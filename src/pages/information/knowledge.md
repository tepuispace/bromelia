# Knowledge


![alt text](../../../public/types-knowledge.png "Types")

Knowledge refers to the understanding, insights, skills, and expertise that individuals possess through their experiences, education, learning, and interactions with the world. It is the result of processing and integrating information and can be classified and subclassified based on various criteria. Here are some common classifications and subclasses of knowledge:

• *Explicit Knowledge* is formal and codified knowledge that can be easily articulated, documented, and shared. It is typically found in textbooks, manuals, databases, or other explicit forms of information. Explicit knowledge can be further classified into:

• *Declarative Knowledge* involves factual information and represents what we know or believe to be true. It includes concepts, principles, facts, and theories.

• *Procedural Knowledge* refers to knowledge of how to do something. It involves knowing the steps, processes, methods, or techniques required to perform a specific task or accomplish a particular goal.

• *Tacit Knowledge* is personal and experiential knowledge that is difficult to formalize or articulate. It is deeply rooted in an individual's experiences, insights, and intuition. Tacit knowledge can be further classified into:

• *Implicit Knowledge* refers to knowledge that individuals possess but may not be consciously aware of. It is often demonstrated through actions, behaviors, or skills without explicit explanation or articulation.

• *Embodied Knowledge* is knowledge that is gained through direct experience and practice. It is deeply ingrained in an individual's physical or sensory abilities and is difficult to transfer to others without direct engagement or observation.

• *Domain-Specific Knowledge* Domain-specific knowledge refers to knowledge that is specific to a particular field, discipline, or domain of expertise. It includes specialized knowledge and terminology that is relevant and applicable within a specific context.

• *Procedural Knowledge* involves knowledge of procedures, methods, or techniques to perform specific tasks or achieve desired outcomes. It focuses on knowing how to do something and includes step-by-step instructions, guidelines, or protocols.

• *Conceptual Knowledge* refers to understanding concepts, principles, and relationships between ideas or entities. It involves knowledge of underlying theories, frameworks, or models that help in organizing and explaining information.

• *Metacognitive Knowledge* involves knowledge about one's own cognitive processes, thinking strategies, and awareness of one's own knowledge and learning. It includes knowledge of how to monitor, regulate, and adapt one's thinking and learning processes.

These are just a few examples of how knowledge can be classified and subclassified based on different dimensions. The classification and subclasses of knowledge may vary depending on the context, discipline, or framework used for categorization.
