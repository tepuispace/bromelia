# Perfomance, enviroment, actuators and sensors

In an agent and multi-agent approach, REAS is an acronym used to describe the main components of an agent:

• *Performance*: Refers to the measure of success or effectiveness with which the agent or system of agents achieves its objectives. Performance can be evaluated based on the specific goals that are set for the agent.

• *Environment*: It is the context in which the agent or system of agents operates and carries out its actions. The environment can be physical, virtual, or a combination of both, and can include elements such as other agents, objects, rules, and environmental conditions.

• *Actuators*: Are the mechanisms or devices used by the agent to perform actions in the environment. Actuators can be motors, physical effectors, communication interfaces, among others, depending on the type of agent and the domain in which it operates.

• *Sensors*: Are the devices or mechanisms used by the agent to perceive or collect information about the environment. The sensors can include cameras, microphones, temperature sensors, motion sensors, among others, depending on the capabilities required for the agent and the characteristics of the environment.

These components are an integral part of an agent's architecture and are fundamental to its functioning and ability to interact with the environment effectively.
