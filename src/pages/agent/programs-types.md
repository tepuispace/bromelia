# Programs types

There are several types of programs for agents and multi-agent systems that are used in the design and development of intelligent systems. Here are some examples of these types of programs:

• *Reactive Programs*: Reactive agents make decisions based solely on the current perception of the environment. They do not maintain an internal model of the world and do not consider the history of past actions or states. They respond directly to environmental stimuli without long-term planning.

• *Model-Based Programs*: Model-based agents maintain an internal model of the world and use this model to reason about the current state and predict the future state of the environment. They can use this knowledge to make planned decisions and anticipate the consequences of their actions.

• *Goal-based Programs*: Goal-based agents have predefined goals or objectives and use information from the environment to determine the actions that will bring them closer to those objectives. These agents can carry out long-term planning to achieve their goals.

• *Utility-Based Programs*: Utility-based agents evaluate the different actions available based on a utility function or evaluation criterion. They choose the actions that maximize the expected utility, taking into account factors such as available resources, risks and agent preferences.

• *Learning Agents*: These agents have the ability to learn and improve their performance through experience. They can use machine learning techniques or reinforcement learning algorithms to adapt to the environment, discover patterns and adjust their behavior based on the rewards or feedback received.

These are just a few examples of programs used in the implementation of agents and multi-agent systems. The choice of the program type depends on the specific requirements of the domain, the capabilities of the agent and the objectives of the system in general. The different approaches are used depending on the complexity of the task, the perception and reasoning ability of the agent, and the level of autonomy and adaptability required.
