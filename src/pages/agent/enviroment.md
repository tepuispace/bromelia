# Environment

In the context of agent and multi-agent environments, there are several properties that characterize the work environments:

• *Observable vs. Partially Observable*: An environment can be observable if the agents have access to the complete and accurate state of the environment at all times. On the other hand, an environment can be partially observable if agents have limited or incomplete information about the environment state, requiring them to maintain beliefs or estimations about the true state.

• *Deterministic vs. Stochastic*: A deterministic environment is one where the next state is completely determined by the current state and the actions of the agents. In contrast, a stochastic environment involves uncertainty, where the next state may be probabilistic, influenced by random factors or unknown events.

• *Episodic vs. Sequential*: An episodic environment is one where the agent's experience is divided into isolated episodes, and the outcome of each episode does not directly affect subsequent episodes. In contrast, a sequential environment has a continuous flow of actions and states, where the consequences of an action in one step can impact future steps.

• *Static vs. Dynamic*: A static environment does not change while the agent is deliberating or executing actions. In contrast, a dynamic environment can change independently over time, requiring agents to adapt and respond to those changes.

• *Discrete vs. Continuous*: A discrete environment has a limited number of distinct states and actions. In contrast, a continuous environment has a potentially infinite number of possible states and actions, often requiring agents to use approximation or continuous control techniques.

• *Single-Agent vs. Multi-Agent*: A single-agent environment involves only one agent operating within the environment, whereas a multi-agent environment consists of multiple agents, each with their own goals, actions, and interactions, leading to more complex dynamics and coordination challenges.

• *Cooperative*: In a cooperative environment, agents work together towards a common goal. Cooperation involves sharing information, coordinating actions, and achieving mutual benefits by collaborating effectively.

• *Competitive*: In a competitive environment, agents have conflicting objectives and compete with each other for limited resources or rewards. Agents need to strategize and compete against others to optimize their own performance and achieve individual goals.

• *Adversarial*: An adversarial environment involves agents that actively oppose and try to obstruct each other's goals. Adversarial scenarios can include competitive games or scenarios where agents try to outwit or deceive each other.

These properties of the environment influence the design and behavior of agents and multi-agent systems, as they determine the nature of the interactions, the complexity of decision-making, and the strategies required to achieve desired outcomes.
